(a) Conventional downsampling and upsampling processes. SLVC is sliding local variance calculation, $4 \times$ is images with 4-fold downsampling followed by restoration to original size, where the processed texture images show differences and roughness compared to the pre-processed images. (b) Wavelet transform downsampling and upsampling processes, where the two texture images before and after processing exhibit extreme similarity.
